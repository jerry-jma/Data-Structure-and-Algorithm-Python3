# Description
# Given some points and an origin in two-dimensional space,Find k points from points which are closest to origin Euclidean.Return to the answer from small to large according to Euclidean distance. If two points have the same Euclidean distance, they are sorted by x values. If the x value is the same, then we sort it by the y value.

# Example
# Example 1:

# Input: points = [[4,6],[4,7],[4,4],[2,5],[1,1]], origin = [0, 0], k = 3
# Output: [[1,1],[2,5],[4,4]]
# Example 2:

# Input: points = [[0,0],[0,9]], origin = [3, 1], k = 1
# Output: [[0,0]]
# Challenge
# O(nlogn) is OK, but can you think of a solution to O(nlogk)ï¼Ÿ
